# Offline Mode

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme'

TeamPlay can run entirely on the client with a local persistent database. To enable this, import the offline connector instead of the default one.

```js
import connect from 'teamplay/connect-offline'

await connect()
```

This uses a local persistent store in the browser and does not require a server connection.

## React Native

React Native requires an extra dependency for persistent storage:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage" />

After installing it, the same `teamplay/connect-offline` import works in React Native.
