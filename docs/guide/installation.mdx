# Installation

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme'

<PackageManagerTabs command="install teamplay" />

TeamPlay can be used in two modes: client-only mode and with server synchronization. Choose the appropriate installation method based on your needs.

## Client-only Mode

If you just want a client-only mode without any data being synced to the server, you don't need to set up anything extra. You can jump directly to the [Usage](/guide/usage) section after installing the package.

## Synchronization with Server

To enable synchronization with the server, follow these steps:

### Client Setup

Enable the connection on the client somewhere early in your client app:

```js
import connect from 'teamplay/connect'
connect()
```

### Server Setup

On the server, you need to create the TeamPlay backend and then create a connection handler for WebSockets:

```js
import { createBackend, initConnection } from 'teamplay/server'

const backend = createBackend()
const { upgrade } = initConnection(backend)
server.on('upgrade', upgrade) // Node's 'http' server instance
```

## Database Configuration

By default no extra database setup is needed and the data is gonna be saved into an SQLite file `local.db` in the root of your project.

You can still use the MongoDB query syntax with aggregations which is emulated using [`mingo`](https://github.com/kofrasa/mingo).

- For production use, it's recommended to use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). It will be automatically used if you set the environment variable `MONGO_URL`.
- When deploying to a cluster with multiple instances, you also have to provide the environment variable `REDIS_URL` ([Redis](https://redis.io)).

:::note
TeamPlay's `createBackend()` is a wrapper around creating a [ShareDB's backend](https://share.github.io/sharedb/api/backend). You can instead manually create a ShareDB backend yourself and pass it to `initConnection()`. `ShareDB` is re-exported from `teamplay/server`, you can get it as `import { ShareDB } from 'teamplay/server'`.

Now that you have TeamPlay installed and configured, you're ready to start using it in your application!
